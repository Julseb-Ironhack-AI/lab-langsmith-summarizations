       " 'text': 'By Duncan Bartlett\\nBBC News, Japan\\nA Japanese legend claims that Jesus escaped Jerusalem and made his way to Aomori in Japan where he became a rice farmer. Christians say the story is nonsense. However, a monument there known as the Grave of Christ attracts curious visitors from all over the world.\\nTo reach the Grave of Christ or Kristo no Hakka as it is known locally, you need to head deep into the northern countryside of Japan, a place of paddy fields and apple orchards.\\nThe Grave of Christ has become an international tourist attraction\\nHalfway up a remote mountain surrounded by a thicket of bamboo lies a mound of bare earth marked with a large wooden cross.\\nMost visitors peer at the grave curiously and pose in front of the cross for a photograph before heading off for apple ice cream at the nearby cafe.\\nBut some pilgrims leave coins in front of the grave in thanks for answered prayers.\\nThe cross is a confusing symbol because according to the local legend, Jesus did not die at Calvary.\\nHis place was taken by one of his brothers, who for some reason is now buried by his side in Japan.\\nThe story goes that after escaping Jerusalem, Jesus made his way across Russia and Siberia to Aomori in the far north of Japan where he became a rice farmer, married, had a family and died peacefully at the age of 114.\\nA villager hinted that I might be able to meet one of Jesus\\' descendents - a Mr Sajiro Sawaguchi, who is now in his 80s.\\nHis family owns the land on which the grave stands and his house is at the foot of the mountain.\\nI set off to find him but was told he was too ill to speak to me.\\nHowever, his grandson Junichiro Sawaguchi did agree to talk. Was I about to meet someone with a true touch of the divine?\\nThe tubby middle-aged gentleman in glasses who spoke to me did not seem particularly Messianic.\\n\"Actually, my family are Buddhists not Christians,\" said Mr Sawaguchi.\\nLocal legend says Mr Sawaguchi (r) is a living descendant of Jesus\\n\"And I don\\'t claim to be a descendent of Jesus although I know some people have said my grandfather is connected to the legend. However, when I was a young child, my mother drew the sign of a cross upon my forehead as a symbol of good fortune,\" he told me.\\nCertainly the cross has brought good fortune to the villagers, who make money from the visitors and the media who seek out the grave.\\nIt has become the region\\'s only internationally recognised tourist attraction.\\nHowever the legend of Jesus the rice farmer does not stretch back very far. It only began in the 1930s with the discovery of what were claimed to be ancient Hebrew documents detailing Jesus\\' life and death in Japan.\\nThose documents have now mysteriously disappeared and the grave has never been excavated. I asked a village official, Masaoki Sato, if he realised that the grave might cause offence to Christians who believe in Jesus\\' crucifixion and resurrection.\\n\"We\\'re not saying that the story is true or what is written in the Bible is wrong,\" he politely explained. \"All we are saying is that this is a very interesting old legend. It\\'s up to the people who come here to decide how they interpret it.\"\\nRitual and tradition\\nMany Japanese find it hard to make sense of Christianity. Schools are banned from teaching any religion and people are generally more interested in ritual and tradition than theology.\\nHowever, Christian-style weddings are enormously popular. They are often held in hotels which have special chapels, complete with crosses and stained glass windows.\\nForeign students are sometimes hired to play the part of the priest, although the whole event has no official sanction from any church.\\nChurchy-looking buildings have other entertainment purposes too.\\nIn the city of Nagoya, I went to a theme restaurant where diners could choose either to have dinner in the chapel, seated on pews and surrounded by paintings of Jesus and the saints, or on the floor below, which is decorated like a prison, complete with metal bars around each table.\\nOnly 1% of Japan is officially Christian. However, there are some lively churches, such as the New Life Ministry in Tokyo.\\nWhen I arrived on Sunday afternoon it was packed with young worshippers, clapping along to songs of praise and raising their hands in joy.\\nI met Pastor Shintaro Watanabe, who was dressed in a floral Hawaiian shirt and had an almost permanent smile on his face.\\nWasn\\'t he shocked by the legend of Jesus\\' grave? He laughed and said it was just a silly story which caused him no particular offence.\\n\"I suppose that many Japanese people feel respect for Jesus and the Bible,\" said the pastor. \"The legend ties in with that. Perhaps it shows that people are looking to make a connection with Jesus in some way.\"\\nHis church is trying to satisfy that spiritual curiosity, just as countless missionaries to Japan have attempted before.\\nYet many Christians have discovered that the Japanese view of religion can be rather baffling - as the grave of Christ the rice farmer reveals.\\nFrom Our Own Correspondent was broadcast on Saturday, 9 September, 2006 at 1130 BST on BBC Radio 4.

It has earned her some of the best reviews of her 22-year career.\\nIn stark contrast to 2003\\'s introspective American Life album, she has dusted off her glitterball, strapped on her pink stilettos and sampled Abba on latest hit single Hung Up.\\nHas Madonna reinvigorated her music career, or is she merely throwing one final dance party for her long-term fans before settling down to record more sedate material?\\nMadonna embraced New York club culture in the early 1980s\\n\"Dance music fans may be unconvinced by Madonna\\'s new image as it no longer reflects her real life,\" says DJ magazine\\'s features editor Carl Loben.\\n\"Madonna embraced the early stages of New York club culture in the 1980s but I doubt she has been into a club for years.\"\\nHowever, Mr Loben says Madonna was very astute to work on her new album with Stuart Price, the respected producer and remixer behind dance acts Les Rythmes Digitales and Zoot Woman.\\nThe fact that Madonna is releasing a second continuous DJ mix version of Confessions on a Dancefloor will also appeal to dance music fans, Mr Loben says.\\n\"Clubbers are generally open to any music as long as it sounds good on the dancefloor.\"\\nWhile clubbers are relatively unconcerned by the age of an artist, Madonna has been permanently ousted from the cover of Smash Hits magazine by acts such as teen stars McFly and Son of Dork.\\nStaff writer Ian Eddy says teenage music fans judge Madonna on a song-by-song basis.\\n\"Pop fans are a bit fickle,\" he says. \"If her next single is a bit of a dud they won\\'t bother with it.\"\\nSmash Hits readers were divided in their opinion of Madonna\\'s promo video for her single Hung Up, in which the 47-year-old contorts herself in a pink leotard and flirts with young dancers.\\n\"A lot of our readers are saying Madonna has still got it, that she is still youthful,\" says Mr Eddy, \"but some say she should grow old a bit more gracefully.\"\\nYoung pop stars may cite Madonna as a music or fashion influence, but teenage music fans \"just don\\'t have the same affection for her as people in their 30s do\".\\nMadonna\\'s most loyal fan group has been gay men, which gay magazine Axm attributes to her eye for fashion and music trends, and her ever-changing image.\\n\"Many gay people want to break away from their past, and every six months Madonna goes into a cocoon then emerges as a new butterfly,\" says Axm editor Matt Miles.\\nShe strengthened her gay and lesbian fanbase by challenging sexual and religious convention in promo videos such as Like A Prayer and Justify My Love, suggestive live performances and 1992\\'s explicit Sex photo book.\\n\"Madonna\\'s gay audience has always been very forgiving, perhaps too forgiving,\" says Mr Miles. \"It would take an awful lot to put gay men off her.\"\\nMr Miles says it is understandable why Madonna would want to \"throw herself back into the gay bosom\" with a new hi-energy album, after the relative failure of American Life.\\n\"Why not? It doesn\\'t seem too cynical, and it worked for Kylie Minogue. It is as if Madonna is sampling the 1980s but making it better.\"\\nGay fans believe Madonna\\'s career will match the longevity of that other iconic US singer, Cher. If her songs match her ambition, she may also retain her revived mainstream audience.\\nWhen not making dance records, Madonna is a children\\'s author\\nMr Eddy says: \"Madonna really thinks of herself as young. I can\\'t see her sticking to dance music but she could easily come back in a few years with something fresh.\"\\n\"Madonna may return to the slower beats of her Ray of Light album or move into torch songs,\" adds Mr Miles. \"She would probably like to turn herself into a cartoon, and is kicking herself that Gorillaz got there first.\"\\nHe concludes: \"She is pushing 50 and still looks great. I wouldn\\'t put it past her to be swinging off a trapeze at the age of 60.\"'}\n",

and public - fashion in California.\\nHomeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff and David Paulison, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), are already on the scene.\\n\"What we see now that we did not see during Hurricane Katrina is a very good team effort from the local, the state and the federal government and across the federal agencies,\" Mr Paulison said.\\nPresident George W Bush wants to \"witness first-hand\" the situation and is due to visit on Thursday, as well as swiftly pledging federal aid to Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.\\nAfter Katrina, he was widely criticised for merely flying over the hurricane-affected areas two days later on his way back from his holiday in Texas to Washington DC.\\nHowever, while the administration\\'s public response and California\\'s evacuation efforts have clearly been better managed than in New Orleans, other questions remain:\\n- given the awareness that dry conditions had created a risk of serious fires, was enough done to prepare?\\n- have California\\'s fire services been given enough funding for staff and equipment?\\n- has the deployment of National Guard troops to Iraq led to a shortage of manpower and firefighting kit?\\nDonald Kettl, professor of political science at the University of Pennsylvania, is certain the response could have been better, had part of California\\'s National Guard not been deployed to Iraq.\\n\"We are simply not as well prepared as we used to be to react to these kinds of disasters because the forces we used to have here are in Iraq, and some of their equipment is too,\" he said.\\nBack in May, Mr Schwarzenegger himself acknowledged that \"a lot of equipment has gone to Iraq, and it doesn\\'t come back when the troops come back\" to California.\\nAt the same time, Lt Col John Siepmann, a spokesman for California\\'s National Guard, told the San Francisco Chronicle that half the equipment needed to respond to a major disaster was not in the state.\\nHowever, Lt Gen Steven Blum, chief of the National Guard Bureau, has denied that deployments to Iraq have overstretched California\\'s resources.\\nSome 1,500 of the state\\'s National Guard troops have been involved in firefighting and humanitarian efforts.\\nMindful of criticisms of a sluggish response after Katrina, the Pentagon has also been quick to put active-duty troops on standby and to lend firefighting aircraft.\\n\"One of the lessons we, as a nation, learned is that in a crisis, you don\\'t wait to be asked,\" said Paul McHale, assistant secretary of defence for homeland defence.\\nDr Kettl agrees that what has been seen in California so far represents \"vast improvements\" as regards the federal government response.\\nMany shelters have been set up for people forced to flee their homes\\n\"In terms of leaders on the scene, it is far better - that was an enormous problem in the case of Katrina,\" he said.\\nBut what will ultimately count will be the state and federal authorities\\' ability to organise aid effectively for those in need, Dr Kettl says.\\nAssessing the response so far, he said: \"The evacuation procedures have been relatively smooth, the shelter and food have been relatively good.\"\\nBut, he adds, it is difficult to draw direct comparisons between Katrina and what is happening in California because of the different nature and scale of the problems faced.\\nThe hurricane and flooding cut off access to emergency shelters in New Orleans, where thousands became stranded without supplies, in a way that has not happened in California.\\nAlso, many of the affected areas in California are wealthier - with residents better able to flee - than was the case in New Orleans, where many of those trapped were poor or elderly.\\nSteve Erie, a political science professor at the University of California, San Diego, is much blunter in his criticism of San Diego County\\'s authorities.\\nHe believes the county\\'s preparedness in terms of firefighting was woefully inadequate - particularly compared to nearby Los Angeles - and that its fire service is seriously under-funded.\\nFour years ago, after fierce wildfires in southern California cost 15 lives, a number of recommendations were made to try to improve emergency readiness.\\nBut, says Prof Erie, San Diego\\'s voters rejected tax increases that would have boosted fire service funding and the authorities \"adopted all the resolutions except those that cost money\".\\nWith 1,500 homes razed, a long road to reconstruction lies ahead\\nAs a result, communications systems and inter-agency coordination have improved, he said, but much more is needed to bring San Diego County\\'s many small fire services up to scratch.\\n\"We have volunteer fire departments that use bake sales to raise money, and we are just taking baby steps towards consolidating them, professionalising them and giving them better equipment - and that\\'s four years later,\" he said.\\nWith more than a dozen fires still blazing and a long path to reconstruction ahead, it may be too early to judge whether all the lessons of Katrina have been taken to heart.\\nBut for some observers, at least, the report card will be mixed.'}\n",

Christians say the story is nonsense. However, a monument there known as the Grave of Christ attracts curious visitors from all over the world.\\nTo reach the Grave of Christ or Kristo no Hakka as it is known locally, you need to head deep into the northern countryside of Japan, a place of paddy fields and apple orchards.\\nThe Grave of Christ has become an international tourist attraction\\nHalfway up a remote mountain surrounded by a thicket of bamboo lies a mound of bare earth marked with a large wooden cross.\\nMost visitors peer at the grave curiously and pose in front of the cross for a photograph before heading off for apple ice cream at the nearby cafe.\\nBut some pilgrims leave coins in front of the grave in thanks for answered prayers.\\nThe cross is a confusing symbol because according to the local legend, Jesus did not die at Calvary.\\nHis place was taken by one of his brothers, who for some reason is now buried by his side in Japan.\\nThe story goes that after escaping Jerusalem, Jesus made his way across Russia and Siberia to Aomori in the far north of Japan where he became a rice farmer, married, had a family and died peacefully at the age of 114.\\nA villager hinted that I might be able to meet one of Jesus\\' descendents - a Mr Sajiro Sawaguchi, who is now in his 80s.\\nHis family owns the land on which the grave stands and his house is at the foot of the mountain.\\nI set off to find him but was told he was too ill to speak to me.\\nHowever, his grandson Junichiro Sawaguchi did agree to talk. Was I about to meet someone with a true touch of the divine?\\nThe tubby middle-aged gentleman in glasses who spoke to me did not seem particularly Messianic.\\n\"Actually, my family are Buddhists not Christians,\" said Mr Sawaguchi.\\nLocal legend says Mr Sawaguchi (r) is a living descendant of Jesus\\n\"And I don\\'t claim to be a descendent of Jesus although I know some people have said my grandfather is connected to the legend. However, when I was a young child, my mother drew the sign of a cross upon my forehead as a symbol of good fortune,\" he told me.\\nCertainly the cross has brought good fortune to the villagers, who make money from the visitors and the media who seek out the grave.\\nIt has become the region\\'s only internationally recognised tourist attraction.\\nHowever the legend of Jesus the rice farmer does not stretch back very far. It only began in the 1930s with the discovery of what were claimed to be ancient Hebrew documents detailing Jesus\\' life and death in Japan.\\nThose documents have now mysteriously disappeared and the grave has never been excavated. I asked a village official, Masaoki Sato, if he realised that the grave might cause offence to Christians who believe in Jesus\\' crucifixion and resurrection.\\n\"We\\'re not saying that the story is true or what is written in the Bible is wrong,\" he politely explained. \"All we are saying is that this is a very interesting old legend. It\\'s up to the people who come here to decide how they interpret it.\"\\nRitual and tradition\\nMany Japanese find it hard to make sense of Christianity. Schools are banned from teaching any religion and people are generally more interested in ritual and tradition than theology.\\nHowever, Christian-style weddings are enormously popular. They are often held in hotels which have special chapels, complete with crosses and stained glass windows.\\nForeign students are sometimes hired to play the part of the priest, although the whole event has no official sanction from any church.\\nChurchy-looking buildings have other entertainment purposes too.\\nIn the city of Nagoya, I went to a theme restaurant where diners could choose either to have dinner in the chapel, seated on pews and surrounded by paintings of Jesus and the saints, or on the floor below, which is decorated like a prison, complete with metal bars around each table.\\nOnly 1% of Japan is officially Christian. However, there are some lively churches, such as the New Life Ministry in Tokyo.\\nWhen I arrived on Sunday afternoon it was packed with young worshippers, clapping along to songs of praise and raising their hands in joy.\\nI met Pastor Shintaro Watanabe, who was dressed in a floral Hawaiian shirt and had an almost permanent smile on his face.\\nWasn\\'t he shocked by the legend of Jesus\\' grave? He laughed and said it was just a silly story which caused him no particular offence.\\n\"I suppose that many Japanese people feel respect for Jesus and the Bible,\" said the pastor. \"The legend ties in with that. Perhaps it shows that people are looking to make a connection with Jesus in some way.\"\\nHis church is trying to satisfy that spiritual curiosity, just as countless missionaries to Japan have attempted before.\\nYet many Christians have discovered that the Japanese view of religion can be rather baffling - as the grave of Christ the rice farmer reveals.\\nFrom Our Own Correspondent was broadcast on Saturday, 9 September, 2006 at 1130 BST on BBC Radio 4.

It was one of hundreds of letters Mr Hill penned to people he thought could help him.\\'Wrong pubs\\'\\nThe six men were from Northern Ireland and had lived in Birmingham since the 1960s.\\nFive of them had left Birmingham New Street train station for Belfast on 21 November 1974, the night the Tavern in the Town and Mulberry Bush pubs were bombed.\\nThey were travelling to Belfast to attend the funeral of James McDade, an IRA member who had blown himself up planting a bomb in Coventry.\\nThe men, some who had been childhood friends with McDade, were arrested in Heysham, Lancashire, as they waited for the ferry to Northern Ireland.\\nMr Mullin\\'s involvement in the case deepened with his passion to prove the men\\'s innocence.\\n\"I was convinced that here were six civilians who were in the wrong place at the wrong time,\" he said.\\n\"They drank in the wrong pubs and clubs - while two of them worked with a man who was a genuine member of the IRA.\"\\nMr Mullin became a researcher for ITV\\'s World in Action in 1985 and aimed to \"see if we could unearth new evidence\" in the case.\\nThe investigative current affairs programme, made by Granada TV, dedicated several editions to discrediting the evidence on which the six men had been convicted.\\nMr Mullin said the main planks of evidence were \"confessions\" by four of the men and forensic evidence which their trial had heard was \"99% accurate\" in showing two had handled explosives.Test doubts\\nExpert witness Frank Skuse said Mr Hill and Mr Power had tested positive for nitroglycerine in Greiss tests - chemical analysis looking for the presence of organic nitrate compounds.\\nOther scientists had argued the test was unreliable because a positive result could be gained from nitrocellulose in a range of innocent products.\\nIn the autumn of 1985, World in Action demonstrated how shuffling an old pack of playing cards containing the substance produced a positive Greiss test. The accused men had played cards on their train journey.\\nMr Mullin said a breakthrough came when an ex-police constable got in touch and \"confirmed many of the violent tactics\" the six claimed were used by the now defunct West Midlands Serious Crime Squad to secure confessions.\\nMr Mullin said the alleged tactics included bringing dogs and shot guns into the cells and \"conducting mock executions\".\\nThe ex-officer was interviewed on World in Action in 1986.\\nIn the same year, Mr Mullin published a book, Error of Judgement: The Truth about the Birmingham bombings, in which he claimed to have traced and met some of those actually responsible for the bombings.\\nAs demands for the case to be re-examined grew in Britain and Ireland, it was referred back to the Court of Appeal by the then home secretary Douglas Hurd. But the convictions were upheld in 1988.\\nIt took three more years of articles, books and documentaries by a growing number of campaigners before the men\\'s convictions were again re-considered.\\nMr Mullin said the day the men were released was among the best of his life.\\n\"It was a very exciting moment,\" he said. \"It came a bit quicker than we anticipated. The Crown had abandoned the forensic evidence and confessions and was trying to upgrade the circumstantial evidence.\\n\"And we had expected Michael Mansfield [defence lawyer] to continue his submissions but he said it was all \\'nonsense\\' and sat down. At which point the judge quashed the convictions and the men were propelled outside to cheering crowds, cameras and helicopters flying overhead.\"\\nEnd Quote Chris Mullin\\nIt was very good to be publicly vindicated”\\nMr Mullin was with the men as they were driven in a convoy of cars to a party put on by the Catholic Chaplaincy in Hampstead.\\nMr Mullin, who was the Labour MP for Sunderland South for 23 years, said he had received a lot of criticism for backing the case and still has the Sun\\'s front page declaring \"Loony MP Backs Bomb Gang\" on his office wall.\\n\"So it was very good to be publicly vindicated so spectacularly,\" he said.\\nThe men\\'s release was a day of celebration for some but for many of those involved in the Birmingham bombings and the aftermath the scars will always remain.\\nThe families and friends of the 21 people killed, and the many who were terribly injured, have never seen justice done.\\nThe IRA is believed to have carried out the bombings but no-one has ever admitted responsibility.\\'Public outcry\\'\\nWest Midlands Police said there were no plans to reopen the inquiry into the pub bombings but \"it would look at any fresh information that came to light\".\\nMr Mullin said a miscarriage of justice such as the Birmingham Six case was \"not likely\" to happen now.\\nInterviews in police custody have to be recorded, a result of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.\\nAnd the Royal Commission, set up after the Birmingham case, established the Criminal Cases Review Commission.\\nOne of the Birmingham Six, Richard McIlkenny, died in 2006, aged 72.\\nIn 2010, Mr Hill, who co-founded the Miscarriages of Justice Organisation (Mojo), won his fight to get trauma counselling on the NHS.\\nHe told the BBC\\'s Hardtalk programme last month he still found it very difficult that none of the police officers he alleges played a part in his imprisonment has been prosecuted.\\nHe said he told those looking for justice it would come from the most unexpected sources.\\nMr Hill added: \"The one thing about the British public - when they see an injustice they are not afraid to stand up and scream about it - and thank God.\\n\"We were put into prison just to satisfy and to quell the public outcry and in the end it was the public outcry that got us back out again.\"'}\n",

She was easily defeated by a Puerto Rican fighter in a judo bout that lasted only 82 seconds.\\'Western influence\\'\\nAs the debate raged over whether Shaherkani should be allowed to take part, her father, Ali, insisted: \"I would never put my religion or my daughter\\'s hijab on the line, even if it meant missing out on the Olympics.\"\\nNoor al-Sajan, a 19-year-old law student living in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, said Mr Shaherkani\\'s remarks did not stop him and his daughter being the subjects of fierce criticism at home.\\n\"There are some who have been very resentful of the fact that she is competing and have been taking it out on her family,\" she said.\\n\"They\\'ve been saying: \\'Oh, he is taking his daughter to the Olympics. He\\'s not man enough.\\'\\n\"Some have also been attacking their racial background, saying: \\'They are not from Saudi, they don\\'t represent us.\\'\\n\"She\\'s 16 years old. I don\\'t know how she\\'s handling all of this. I think it\\'s really hard.\"\\nAbdullah Qassem, a Saudi businessman living in Jeddah, said he personally had no problem with Saudi women participating in sports, but he feared that they could be influenced by Western culture.\\n\"The fear is that the women would go [to the Olympics] and expose their bodies,\" he explained.\\n\"Yes, this time the Saudi women are covering [their bodies], but who\\'s to say that they won\\'t copy the European women and start dressing like them?\"\\'Prostitutes of the Olympics\\'\\nEven the appearance of Shaherkani and the second Saudi female athlete in London, Sarah Attar, along with their male counterparts in the opening ceremony last Friday earned them an Arabic hashtag on the social networking website, Twitter, which translates as \"prostitutes of the Olympics\".\\nIt was not long before the hashtag was trending on Twitter, but Noor al-Sajan said it was being used to the athletes\\' benefit.\\n\"Activists have turned the hashtag around. They decided to use it to write positive things about the athletes since the hashtag was already viral,\" she said.\\nIronically it worked, and hundreds of tweets were written in support of Shaherkani and Attar.\\n\"Give Saudi women both the Olympic torch and the keys to the car,\" said one tweet, referring to the ban on women driving in the Gulf kingdom.\\nAnother tweet said: \"Even though Saudi allowed women to be in their Olympics team - the degrading of women lives on with this hashtag.\"\\nDespite the controversy Ms Sajan remains optimistic. Saudi Arabia, after all, is a country where women are still fighting for their right to drive and go anywhere without being chaperoned.\\n\"I think it\\'s a great milestone for Saudi women. The Olympics is one the biggest international sports events,\" she added.\\n\"If the community here sees that it\\'s OK for women to play sports, maybe that would make it easier for women to play professionally here.\"'}\n",

It has earned her some of the best reviews of her 22-year career.\\nIn stark contrast to 2003\\'s introspective American Life album, she has dusted off her glitterball, strapped on her pink stilettos and sampled Abba on latest hit single Hung Up.\\nHas Madonna reinvigorated her music career, or is she merely throwing one final dance party for her long-term fans before settling down to record more sedate material?\\nMadonna embraced New York club culture in the early 1980s\\n\"Dance music fans may be unconvinced by Madonna\\'s new image as it no longer reflects her real life,\" says DJ magazine\\'s features editor Carl Loben.\\n\"Madonna embraced the early stages of New York club culture in the 1980s but I doubt she has been into a club for years.\"\\nHowever, Mr Loben says Madonna was very astute to work on her new album with Stuart Price, the respected producer and remixer behind dance acts Les Rythmes Digitales and Zoot Woman.\\nThe fact that Madonna is releasing a second continuous DJ mix version of Confessions on a Dancefloor will also appeal to dance music fans, Mr Loben says.\\n\"Clubbers are generally open to any music as long as it sounds good on the dancefloor.\"\\nWhile clubbers are relatively unconcerned by the age of an artist, Madonna has been permanently ousted from the cover of Smash Hits magazine by acts such as teen stars McFly and Son of Dork.\\nStaff writer Ian Eddy says teenage music fans judge Madonna on a song-by-song basis.\\n\"Pop fans are a bit fickle,\" he says. \"If her next single is a bit of a dud they won\\'t bother with it.\"\\nSmash Hits readers were divided in their opinion of Madonna\\'s promo video for her single Hung Up, in which the 47-year-old contorts herself in a pink leotard and flirts with young dancers.\\n\"A lot of our readers are saying Madonna has still got it, that she is still youthful,\" says Mr Eddy, \"but some say she should grow old a bit more gracefully.\"\\nYoung pop stars may cite Madonna as a music or fashion influence, but teenage music fans \"just don\\'t have the same affection for her as people in their 30s do\".\\nMadonna\\'s most loyal fan group has been gay men, which gay magazine Axm attributes to her eye for fashion and music trends, and her ever-changing image.\\n\"Many gay people want to break away from their past, and every six months Madonna goes into a cocoon then emerges as a new butterfly,\" says Axm editor Matt Miles.\\nShe strengthened her gay and lesbian fanbase by challenging sexual and religious convention in promo videos such as Like A Prayer and Justify My Love, suggestive live performances and 1992\\'s explicit Sex photo book.\\n\"Madonna\\'s gay audience has always been very forgiving, perhaps too forgiving,\" says Mr Miles. \"It would take an awful lot to put gay men off her.\"\\nMr Miles says it is understandable why Madonna would want to \"throw herself back into the gay bosom\" with a new hi-energy album, after the relative failure of American Life.\\n\"Why not? It doesn\\'t seem too cynical, and it worked for Kylie Minogue. It is as if Madonna is sampling the 1980s but making it better.\"\\nGay fans believe Madonna\\'s career will match the longevity of that other iconic US singer, Cher. If her songs match her ambition, she may also retain her revived mainstream audience.\\nWhen not making dance records, Madonna is a children\\'s author\\nMr Eddy says: \"Madonna really thinks of herself as young. I can\\'t see her sticking to dance music but she could easily come back in a few years with something fresh.\"\\n\"Madonna may return to the slower beats of her Ray of Light album or move into torch songs,\" adds Mr Miles. \"She would probably like to turn herself into a cartoon, and is kicking herself that Gorillaz got there first.\"\\nHe concludes: \"She is pushing 50 and still looks great. I wouldn\\'t put it past her to be swinging off a trapeze at the age of 60.\"'}\n",

that was an enormous problem in the case of Katrina,\" he said.\\nBut what will ultimately count will be the state and federal authorities\\' ability to organise aid effectively for those in need, Dr Kettl says.\\nAssessing the response so far, he said: \"The evacuation procedures have been relatively smooth, the shelter and food have been relatively good.\"\\nBut, he adds, it is difficult to draw direct comparisons between Katrina and what is happening in California because of the different nature and scale of the problems faced.\\nThe hurricane and flooding cut off access to emergency shelters in New Orleans, where thousands became stranded without supplies, in a way that has not happened in California.\\nAlso, many of the affected areas in California are wealthier -

Christians say the story is nonsense. However, a monument there known as the Grave of Christ attracts curious visitors from all over the world.\\nTo reach the Grave of Christ or Kristo no Hakka as it is known locally, you need to head deep into the northern countryside of Japan, a place of paddy fields and apple orchards.\\nThe Grave of Christ has become an international tourist attraction\\nHalfway up a remote mountain surrounded by a thicket of bamboo lies a mound of bare earth marked with a large wooden cross.\\nMost visitors peer at the grave curiously and pose in front of the cross for a photograph before heading off for apple ice cream at the nearby cafe.\\nBut some pilgrims leave coins in front of the grave in thanks for answered prayers.\\nThe cross is a confusing symbol because according to the local legend, Jesus did not die at Calvary.\\nHis place was taken by one of his brothers, who for some reason is now buried by his side in Japan.\\nThe story goes that after escaping Jerusalem, Jesus made his way across Russia and Siberia to Aomori in the far north of Japan where he became a rice farmer, married, had a family and died peacefully at the age of 114.\\nA villager hinted that I might be able to meet one of Jesus\\' descendents - a Mr Sajiro Sawaguchi, who is now in his 80s.\\nHis family owns the land on which the grave stands and his house is at the foot of the mountain.\\nI set off to find him but was told he was too ill to speak to me.\\nHowever, his grandson Junichiro Sawaguchi did agree to talk. Was I about to meet someone with a true touch of the divine?\\nThe tubby middle-aged gentleman in glasses who spoke to me did not seem particularly Messianic.\\n\"Actually, my family are Buddhists not Christians,\" said Mr Sawaguchi.\\nLocal legend says Mr Sawaguchi (r) is a living descendant of Jesus\\n\"And I don\\'t claim to be a descendent of Jesus although I know some people have said my grandfather is connected to the legend. However, when I was a young child, my mother drew the sign of a cross upon my forehead as a symbol of good fortune,\" he told me.\\nCertainly the cross has brought good fortune to the villagers, who make money from the visitors and the media who seek out the grave.\\nIt has become the region\\'s only internationally recognised tourist attraction.\\nHowever the legend of Jesus the rice farmer does not stretch back very far. It only began in the 1930s with the discovery of what were claimed to be ancient Hebrew documents detailing Jesus\\' life and death in Japan.\\nThose documents have now mysteriously disappeared and the grave has never been excavated. I asked a village official, Masaoki Sato, if he realised that the grave might cause offence to Christians who believe in Jesus\\' crucifixion and resurrection.\\n\"We\\'re not saying that the story is true or what is written in the Bible is wrong,\" he politely explained. \"All we are saying is that this is a very interesting old legend. It\\'s up to the people who come here to decide how they interpret it.\"\\nRitual and tradition\\nMany Japanese find it hard to make sense of Christianity. Schools are banned from teaching any religion and people are generally more interested in ritual and tradition than theology.\\nHowever, Christian-style weddings are enormously popular. They are often held in hotels which have special chapels, complete with crosses and stained glass windows.\\nForeign students are sometimes hired to play the part of the priest, although the whole event has no official sanction from any church.\\nChurchy-looking buildings have other entertainment purposes too.\\nIn the city of Nagoya, I went to a theme restaurant where diners could choose either to have dinner in the chapel, seated on pews and surrounded by paintings of Jesus and the saints, or on the floor below, which is decorated like a prison, complete with metal bars around each table.\\nOnly 1% of Japan is officially Christian. However, there are some lively churches, such as the New Life Ministry in Tokyo.\\nWhen I arrived on Sunday afternoon it was packed with young worshippers, clapping along to songs of praise and raising their hands in joy.\\nI met Pastor Shintaro Watanabe, who was dressed in a floral Hawaiian shirt and had an almost permanent smile on his face.\\nWasn\\'t he shocked by the legend of Jesus\\' grave? He laughed and said it was just a silly story which caused him no particular offence.\\n\"I suppose that many Japanese people feel respect for Jesus and the Bible,\" said the pastor. \"The legend ties in with that. Perhaps it shows that people are looking to make a connection with Jesus in some way.\"\\nHis church is trying to satisfy that spiritual curiosity, just as countless missionaries to Japan have attempted before.\\nYet many Christians have discovered that the Japanese view of religion can be rather baffling - as the grave of Christ the rice farmer reveals.\\nFrom Our Own Correspondent was broadcast on Saturday, 9 September, 2006 at 1130 BST on BBC Radio 4.

I don\\'t know how she\\'s handling all of this”\\nThe Saudi authorities had agreed to send women to the games on condition that they agreed to wear Islamic clothing, including headscarves.\\nThe team had threatened to withdraw Shaherkani from the competition before an agreement was finally reached with the IJF that the 16-year-old would fight wearing a special headscarf in order to comply with both safety issues and the Saudi dress code.\\n\"Working with the International Olympic Committee (IOC), a proposal was approved by all parties. The solution agreed guarantees a good balance between safety and cultural considerations,\" the IJF said in a statement.\\nShaherkani competed on Friday in the +78kg category. She was easily defeated by a Puerto Rican fighter in a judo bout that lasted only 82 seconds.\\'Western influence\\'\\nAs the debate raged over whether Shaherkani should be allowed to take part, her father, Ali, insisted: \"I would never put my religion or my daughter\\'s hijab on the line, even if it meant missing out on the Olympics.\"\\nNoor al-Sajan, a 19-year-old law student living in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, said Mr Shaherkani\\'s remarks did not stop him and his daughter being the subjects of fierce criticism at home.\\n\"There are some who have been very resentful of the fact that she is competing and have been taking it out on her family,\" she said.\\n\"They\\'ve been saying: \\'Oh, he is taking his daughter to the Olympics. He\\'s not man enough.\\'\\n\"Some have also been attacking their racial background, saying: \\'They are not from Saudi, they don\\'t represent us.\\'\\n\"She\\'s 16 years old. I don\\'t know how she\\'s handling all of this. I think it\\'s really hard.\"\\nAbdullah Qassem, a Saudi businessman living in Jeddah, said he personally had no problem with Saudi women participating in sports, but he feared that they could be influenced by Western culture.\\n\"The fear is that the women would go [to the Olympics] and expose their bodies,\" he explained.\\n\"Yes, this time the Saudi women are covering [their bodies], but who\\'s to say that they won\\'t copy the European women and start dressing like them?\"\\'Prostitutes of the Olympics\\'\\nEven the appearance of Shaherkani and the second Saudi female athlete in London, Sarah Attar, along with their male counterparts in the opening ceremony last Friday earned them an Arabic hashtag on the social networking website, Twitter, which translates as \"prostitutes of the Olympics\".\\nIt was not long before the hashtag was trending on Twitter, but Noor al-Sajan said it was being used to the athletes\\' benefit.\\n\"Activists have turned the hashtag around. They decided to use it to write positive things about the athletes since the hashtag was already viral,\" she said.\\nIronically it worked, and hundreds of tweets were written in support of Shaherkani and Attar.\\n\"Give Saudi women both the Olympic torch and the keys to the car,\" said one tweet, referring to the ban on women driving in the Gulf kingdom.\\nAnother tweet said: \"Even though Saudi allowed women to be in their Olympics team - the degrading of women lives on with this hashtag.\"\\nDespite the controversy Ms Sajan remains optimistic. Saudi Arabia, after all, is a country where women are still fighting for their right to drive and go anywhere without being chaperoned.\\n\"I think it\\'s a great milestone for Saudi women. The Olympics is one the biggest international sports events,\" she added.\\n\"If the community here sees that it\\'s OK for women to play sports, maybe that would make it easier for women to play professionally here.\"'}\n",

It was one of hundreds of letters Mr Hill penned to people he thought could help him.\\'Wrong pubs\\'\\nThe six men were from Northern Ireland and had lived in Birmingham since the 1960s.\\nFive of them had left Birmingham New Street train station for Belfast on 21 November 1974, the night the Tavern in the Town and Mulberry Bush pubs were bombed.\\nThey were travelling to Belfast to attend the funeral of James McDade, an IRA member who had blown himself up planting a bomb in Coventry.\\nThe men, some who had been childhood friends with McDade, were arrested in Heysham, Lancashire, as they waited for the ferry to Northern Ireland.\\nMr Mullin\\'s involvement in the case deepened with his passion to prove the men\\'s innocence.\\n\"I was convinced that here were six civilians who were in the wrong place at the wrong time,\" he said.\\n\"They drank in the wrong pubs and clubs - while two of them worked with a man who was a genuine member of the IRA.\"\\nMr Mullin became a researcher for ITV\\'s World in Action in 1985 and aimed to \"see if we could unearth new evidence\" in the case.\\nThe investigative current affairs programme, made by Granada TV, dedicated several editions to discrediting the evidence on which the six men had been convicted.\\nMr Mullin said the main planks of evidence were \"confessions\" by four of the men and forensic evidence which their trial had heard was \"99% accurate\" in showing two had handled explosives.Test doubts\\nExpert witness Frank Skuse said Mr Hill and Mr Power had tested positive for nitroglycerine in Greiss tests - chemical analysis looking for the presence of organic nitrate compounds.\\nOther scientists had argued the test was unreliable because a positive result could be gained from nitrocellulose in a range of innocent products.\\nIn the autumn of 1985, World in Action demonstrated how shuffling an old pack of playing cards containing the substance produced a positive Greiss test. The accused men had played cards on their train journey.\\nMr Mullin said a breakthrough came when an ex-police constable got in touch and \"confirmed many of the violent tactics\" the six claimed were used by the now defunct West Midlands Serious Crime Squad to secure confessions.\\nMr Mullin said the alleged tactics included bringing dogs and shot guns into the cells and \"conducting mock executions\".\\nThe ex-officer was interviewed on World in Action in 1986.\\nIn the same year, Mr Mullin published a book, Error of Judgement: The Truth about the Birmingham bombings, in which he claimed to have traced and met some of those actually responsible for the bombings.\\nAs demands for the case to be re-examined grew in Britain and Ireland, it was referred back to the Court of Appeal by the then home secretary Douglas Hurd. But the convictions were upheld in 1988.\\nIt took three more years of articles, books and documentaries by a growing number of campaigners before the men\\'s convictions were again re-considered.\\nMr Mullin said the day the men were released was among the best of his life.\\n\"It was a very exciting moment,\" he said. \"It came a bit quicker than we anticipated. The Crown had abandoned the forensic evidence and confessions and was trying to upgrade the circumstantial evidence.\\n\"And we had expected Michael Mansfield [defence lawyer] to continue his submissions but he said it was all \\'nonsense\\' and sat down. At which point the judge quashed the convictions and the men were propelled outside to cheering crowds, cameras and helicopters flying overhead.\"\\nEnd Quote Chris Mullin\\nIt was very good to be publicly vindicated”\\nMr Mullin was with the men as they were driven in a convoy of cars to a party put on by the Catholic Chaplaincy in Hampstead.\\nMr Mullin, who was the Labour MP for Sunderland South for 23 years, said he had received a lot of criticism for backing the case and still has the Sun\\'s front page declaring \"Loony MP Backs Bomb Gang\" on his office wall.\\n\"So it was very good to be publicly vindicated so spectacularly,\" he said.\\nThe men\\'s release was a day of celebration for some but for many of those involved in the Birmingham bombings and the aftermath the scars will always remain.\\nThe families and friends of the 21 people killed, and the many who were terribly injured, have never seen justice done.\\nThe IRA is believed to have carried out the bombings but no-one has ever admitted responsibility.\\'Public outcry\\'\\nWest Midlands Police said there were no plans to reopen the inquiry into the pub bombings but \"it would look at any fresh information that came to light\".\\nMr Mullin said a miscarriage of justice such as the Birmingham Six case was \"not likely\" to happen now.\\nInterviews in police custody have to be recorded, a result of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.\\nAnd the Royal Commission, set up after the Birmingham case, established the Criminal Cases Review Commission.\\nOne of the Birmingham Six, Richard McIlkenny, died in 2006, aged 72.\\nIn 2010, Mr Hill, who co-founded the Miscarriages of Justice Organisation (Mojo), won his fight to get trauma counselling on the NHS.\\nHe told the BBC\\'s Hardtalk programme last month he still found it very difficult that none of the police officers he alleges played a part in his imprisonment has been prosecuted.\\nHe said he told those looking for justice it would come from the most unexpected sources.\\nMr Hill added: \"The one thing about the British public - when they see an injustice they are not afraid to stand up and scream about it - and thank God.\\n\"We were put into prison just to satisfy and to quell the public outcry and in the end it was the public outcry that got us back out again.\"'}\n",
